# Node Simple Authentication Server
> Create a simple login/register portal for node

## Getting Started

This project was created for instruction for a [javascriptU](http://javascriptU.org) lecture

This project relies on [Redis](http://redis.io) So you will need a running Redis instance

And Of Coarse [Node](http://nodejs.org/)

## Technologies/Libraries making this possible

- [Express](http://expressjs.com/) (Express is a minimal and flexible node.js web application framework, providing a robust set of features for building single and multi-page, and hybrid web applications.)
- [Node_Redis](https://github.com/mranney/node_redis) (This is a complete Redis client for node.js. It supports all Redis commands, including many recently added commands like EVAL from experimental Redis server branches.)
- [HiRedis](https://github.com/antirez/hiredis) (Hiredis is a minimalistic C client library for the Redis database.)
- [Connect-Redis](https://github.com/visionmedia/connect-redis) (connect-redis is a Redis session store backed by node_redis, and is insanely fast)
- [Less](http://lesscss.org/) (LESS extends CSS with dynamic behavior such as variables, mixins, operations and functions.)
- [Less-Middleware](https://github.com/emberfeather/less.js-middleware) (Less middleware for Express)
- [Nohm](https://github.com/maritz/nohm) (Nohm is an object relational mapper (ORM) written for node.js and redis.)
- [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) (Jade is a high performance template engine heavily influenced by Haml and implemented with JavaScript for node.)
- [Passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) (Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application.)

## Running Node Server

'node app.js'

This will start a node server on http://127.0.0.1:3000

Enjoy...
