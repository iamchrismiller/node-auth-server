# Node Simple Authentication Server
> Create a simple login/register portal for node

## Getting Started

This project was created for instruction for a [javascriptU][] lecture

This project relies on [Redis][] So you will need a running Redis instance

And Of Coarse [Node]

[javascriptU] : http://javascriptU.org
[Redis] : http://redis.io
[Node] : http://nodejs.org/

## Technologies/Libraries making this possible

- [Express][] (Express is a minimal and flexible node.js web application framework, providing a robust set of features for building single and multi-page, and hybrid web applications.)
- [Node_Redis][] (This is a complete Redis client for node.js. It supports all Redis commands, including many recently added commands like EVAL from experimental Redis server branches.)
- [HiRedis][] (Hiredis is a minimalistic C client library for the Redis database.)
- [Connect-Redis][] (connect-redis is a Redis session store backed by node_redis, and is insanely fast)
- [Less][] (LESS extends CSS with dynamic behavior such as variables, mixins, operations and functions.)
- [Less-Middleware][] (Less middleware for Express)
- [Nohm][] (Nohm is an object relational mapper (ORM) written for node.js and redis.)
- [Jade][] (Jade is a high performance template engine heavily influenced by Haml and implemented with JavaScript for node.)
- [Passport][] (Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application.)

## Running Node Server

'node app.js'

This will start a node server on http://127.0.0.1:3000

Enjoy...
